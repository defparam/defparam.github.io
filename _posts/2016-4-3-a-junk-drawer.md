title: A Junk Drawer for Embedded Servants
---
Hi! and welcome to this average collection of random hardware hacks and potentially buggy software. My name is Evan (@defparam) and this website is my holding tank of my random ideas and projects that are particularly interesting to me. As you may come to find out, most of the topics I research revolve around embedded design, retro gaming, security, tools and hardware/FPGA design. I went to school for this, I work with this and I spend my free time with this, I am an embedded servant. Half of the motivation for creating such a site is to publish beautiful PoC that may be useful to other embedded servants. The other half is for my own reference as I tend to forget a lot of nitty gritty details when context switching between different projects. 

In any case, feel free to browse around and make yourself at home. The best way to contact me is on twitter @defparam
