# 21FX - (a.k.a SNES-Hook) #

21FX is a collaborative project between byuu and myself. The project started directly from the research I conducted on the SNES expansion port and an original FPGA-based port snooping project called SNES-Tap. The hardware research done with SNES-Tap made it possible to create a very small CPLD based design to take control of the CPU on reset and NMI to force the processor into executing instructions at $2184. Details of how this works will be explained here in future updates.

With this hack it is now possible to:

* Create primary/secondary bootloaders for the SNES regardless of CART hardware
* Dump any SFC CART hardware
* Inspect any SFC CART hardware and co-processors
* Execute homebrew ROMs in memory or memory expansion cart
* Hook into NMI to modify in game memory
* etc...

Since this project is on-going more details will be released in the future (Once we test the final IPLROM i'll update all the repositories, sorry!). For now here are some of the images/models of the device using the SNES Expansion Bridge.
