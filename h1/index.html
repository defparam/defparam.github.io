        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>Hackerone Stats is a bunch of automation built to keep track of data from all public bounty programs listed on Hackerone. Hackerone does a great job compiling metrics on hackers by utilizing reputation/impact scores and managing leaderboards. However, while comparing the performance of other hackers to each other is important, it does not give you the full picture on how the bounty programs themselves are doing. Hackerone Stats was created to provide data on these bounty programs to provide all hackers the important day to day information of their performance.</p>
		<h1>How?</h1>
		<p>Everything on Hackerone Stats is fully automated for the most part. So far here is a list of things h1stats does:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>We capture bounty program data every night at 11:30 PM Eastern</li>
		  <li>We calculate payout changes for each program and post a top 10 image on twitter at midnight eastern time</li>
		  <li>We calculate resolved report changes for each program and post a top 10 image on twitter at midnight eastern time</li>
		  <li>We calculate other high level stats and post them to twitter at midnight eastern time</li>
		  <li>All captured bounty data is checked into github and published on this website</li>
		  <li>The main tool that is used is: <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1stats">https://github.com/defparam/h1stats</a></li>
        </ul>
		<h1>Twitter Diagrams</h1>
		<p>Each night our sleepless robot collects point-in-time data from Hackerone public sources and tweets out 3 images. The first image is the top 10 bounty payments made on that day. These payments are calculated by taking the total bounty payments of the program today and subtracting them from their total bounty payments from yesterday. The first column is the program name, the second column is the bounty payout for that day and the third column is delta of the previous day payout with an up/down indicator. The second image is the top 10 resolved reports made from all bounty and non-bounty programs on Hackerone that day. The first column is the program name, the second column is the total reports resolved for that day and the third column is delta of the previous day resolved reports with an up/down indicator. Lastly, the final image tweeted is the summed-up information for Hackerone on that day. The number of programs in total, the total bounty payments made by all programs and the total reports resolved by all programs.</p>
